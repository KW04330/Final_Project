                <h3>Details about Pinnebog River</h3>
                <p>The Pinnebog River, located in Michigan's Thumb region, is a small 
                    and peaceful river that flows through Huron County into Saginaw Bay 
                    on Lake Huron. Known for its natural beauty, the river is popular 
                    for recreational activities such as fishing, kayaking, and canoeing.
                </p>
                <p>The Pinnebog River offers anglers the chance to catch a variety of fish, particularly:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Smallmouth Bass: Common in the lower stretches of the river.</li>
                    <li>Northern Pike: Found in deeper pools and near the mouth of the river.</li>
                    <li>Yellow Perch: Occasionally caught, especially closer to Saginaw Bay.</li>
                    <li>Sunfish and Bluegill: Common in slower-moving stretches.</li>
                    <li>Catfish: Found near the confluence with Saginaw Bay.</li>
